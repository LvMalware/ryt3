# RYT3 - Route Your Traffic Through Tor

This script provides an easy way to anonymize your traffic by routing it trough the [Tor network](http://wiki.torproject.org/). It was originally written for my personal use only, but I decided to share it here as some other people might find it helpful.

However, as usually I can't make any guarantees about the security and/or effectiveness of this tool and you definitely shouldn't blindly trust it. If you want a more reliable solution, take a look at [Nipe](https://github.com/htrgouvea/nipe).
